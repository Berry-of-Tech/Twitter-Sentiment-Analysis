# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an active field of research in data science that deals with the interaction between human language and computers. One of the most popular applications of NLP is sentiment analysis, which involves the use of algorithms to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text. This field has significantly revolutionized the way businesses operate, from opinion polls to developing entire marketing strategies. Therefore, every data scientist must have a good understanding of this area.

Processing thousands of text documents for sentiment and other features can now take seconds with AI, instead of hours with a human team.

This project aims to classify text on Twitter to determine if it is racist/sexist or not.
